# SyncSketch Unity Plugin

[SyncSketch](https://www.syncsketch.com/) plugin for Unity.  
Take screenshots and record videos, and send them to your SyncSketch project all within Unity!

Select the relevant branch based on your Unity version:

- [`dev_5.6`](https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-unity/tree/dev_5.6) for **Unity 5.6+**
- [`dev_2018.3`](https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-unity/tree/dev_2018.3) for **Unity 2018.3** and **2018.4**
- [`dev_2019.1`](https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-unity/tree/dev_2019.1) for **Unity 2019.1+**

You will find installation instructions there.

# Limitations

- Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRP) only work with Unity 2019.1+ using the [`dev_2019.1`](https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-unity/tree/dev_2019.1) branch
- HDRP doesn't work properly: nothing will be displayed on screen while recording a video
